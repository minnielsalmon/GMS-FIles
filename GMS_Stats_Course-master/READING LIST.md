# Recommended reading for the GMS Statistics Course

    “Never trust anyone who has not brought a book with them.”
    – Lemony Snicket


This document lists books and articles relevant to the material covered in the GMS statistics course.
None of this material is required reading for our course, but if you're looking for thoroughly good
reads that complement the statistics training, this is a great place to start.  (Teachers may of course ask you to read specific things).

## Books

"*Computer Age Statistical Inference*", by Bradley Efron and Trevor Hastie.  This is [freely available](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI/) online and covers many topics relevant to the course.

"*Biological Sequence Analysis*" by Richard Durbin et al.  Seminal book on sequence aligment problems and on hidden markov models.

"*Bayesian Data Analysis*" by Gelman, Carlin, Stern, Dunson, Vehtari, and Rubin - seminal book for Bayesian analysts.

"*Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms*" by David MacKay - a range of topics covered in a readable way. Includes the information-theoretic view of statistics, distributions, MCMC and Gibbs sampling, Laplace method, ...
