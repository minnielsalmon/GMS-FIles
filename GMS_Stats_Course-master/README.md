# GMS Statistics Programme 2019
Content for the GMS Statistics Course

Content for each section of the course is in the relevant folder:

* [Introduction to Statistics](https://github.com/jpwhalley/GMS_Stats_Course/tree/master/1_Introduction_to_Statistics)
* [Statistical Modelling](https://github.com/jpwhalley/GMS_Stats_Course/tree/master/2_Statistical_Modelling)
* [Introduction Bayesian Modelling](https://github.com/jpwhalley/GMS_Stats_Course/tree/master/3_Introduction_Bayesian_Modelling)
* [Introduction to GWAS](https://github.com/jpwhalley/GMS_Stats_Course/tree/master/4_Introduction_to_GWAS)
* [Statistical Analysis of Genome-wide data](https://github.com/jpwhalley/GMS_Stats_Course/tree/master/5_Statistical_Analysis_of_Genome-wide_data)
* [Machine Learning Applications](https://github.com/jpwhalley/GMS_Stats_Course/tree/master/5_Machine_Learning_Applications)

Students please read the README in the relevant folder before each section of the course.  In particular, please try to install any computing requirements beforehand.  As a basic minimum you are likely to need:

1. [Anaconda3 (for python3 notebooks)](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
2. [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)

Specific modules will also require specific packages or other software to be installed - these are detailed in the README files in each folder, and/or will be communicated by teachers beforehand.
